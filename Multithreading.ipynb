    "A deadlock is a situation where two or more threads are blocked indefinitely, waiting for each other to release resources that they hold. In other words, it's a state where threads are unable to proceed because the resources they need are locked by other threads, and those threads are waiting for resources held by the first set of threads. This circular dependency leads to a deadlock.\"\"\""
