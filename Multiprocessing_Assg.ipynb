       "\" Q2. Multiprocessing and multithreading are both techniques used to achieve concurrent execution in a program, but they differ in how they utilize system resources and manage parallelism. Here are the main differences between multiprocessing and multithreading:\\n\\nExecution model: In multiprocessing, multiple processes are created, each with its own memory space and resources. These processes run independently and can execute tasks concurrently on different CPU cores. In multithreading, multiple threads are created within a single process. Threads share the same memory space and resources of the parent process and can execute tasks concurrently within that process.\\n\\nSystem resource usage: Each process created in multiprocessing has its own memory space, which means that they don't directly share data. Inter-process communication (IPC) mechanisms like pipes, queues, or shared memory are used to exchange data between processes. On the other hand, threads created in multithreading share the same memory space of the parent process, allowing them to directly access and modify shared data. This shared memory makes communication between threads easier and faster.\\n\\nOverhead: Creating and managing processes in multiprocessing incurs more overhead compared to threads in multithreading. Creating a process requires duplicating the entire memory space of the parent process, which can be time-consuming and memory-intensive. In multithreading, creating a thread is relatively lightweight, as it only requires creating a new execution context within the existing process.\\n\\nParallelism: Multiprocessing achieves true parallelism by executing tasks on multiple CPU cores simultaneously, allowing for significant performance improvements with CPU-bound tasks. In contrast, multithreading provides concurrency but typically doesn't achieve true parallelism, especially in the case of CPU-bound tasks. This is due to the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) in CPython, the reference implementation of Python, which allows only one thread to execute Python bytecode at a time, preventing true parallel execution of multiple threads.\\n\\nFault tolerance: In multiprocessing, if one process crashes or encounters an error, it won't affect other processes. Each process runs independently and has its own memory space. In multithreading, an error in one thread can potentially crash the entire process since threads share the same memory space. Therefore, multithreading requires careful synchronization mechanisms to protect shared data and avoid issues like race conditions or deadlocks.\\n\\n\""
